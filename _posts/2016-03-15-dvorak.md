title: Dump QWERTY

The way in which we interact with computers has remained largely
unchanged since the first ever typewriter. Its Qwerty keyboard layout
was cleverly designed to minimise mechanical jams, which is not
something that concerns the typists of today. Qwerty has been, and
will be with us for as long as keyboards exist but don't let that stop
you: its time to switch to a modern alternative.

## Dvorak

Introducing the Dvorak keyboard. Zealots of the most popular
alternative to Qwerty claim that their layout is more efficient and
reduces workload. In truth there is still conflicting evidence over
this. However, my supervisor, himself a proponent of the Dvorak
keyboard, challenged me to make the switch: "what else is a PhD for?".

## Join the Dvark side

Whether the Dvorak keyboard really is more efficient or not, there is
another far more compelling reason to switch. Like most frequent
typists, I could type without looking down but it wasn't pretty; I
hadn't learned to touch-type and I was relying on muscle memory. The
best way to improve typing efficiency is to learn to type with all
your fingers and spread the workload. In my experience, it is
impossible to change your behaviour after years of typing on
Qwerty. Switching to Dvorak forced me to start with a blank slate. I
learned to keep my fingers on the home row, and touch-type like a
pro. This style of typing is the launch pad to send your keyboard
skills into the stratosphere, and you're going nowhere without it.

So dump Qwerty, choose a
[new layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout), and learn
to type all over again.

### FAQs

My journey from Qwerty to Dvorak generated some interest in the
office. Here are the most common questions that I was asked:


**How long does it take?** The first week was very hard. It requires
resiliance, concentration, and above all patience. You won't get
things done fast. Week 2 becomes more bearable. Writing for long
periods of time are still tiring. Over weeks 3-4, typing felt more
natural and I quickly improved: I nailed my emacs key bindings and
made less mistakes.


**Can you still use Qwerty?** Yes. I still have some muscle memory but
I have to look down often. If you practice both keyboards at the same
time, you could be proficient in both.


**What about texting?** Typing Qwerty on a phone is as natural as
ever. Those thumbs can still do their thing.


**Any disadvantages?** As a programmer, I often need to use braces and
brackets. The right hand little finger has to work quite hard in these
situations. The
[Dvorak Programmer layout](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/)
looks like a promising solution but has less support.

**Where do I start?** There are some great resources out there. Start
with [thetypingcat.com](http://thetypingcat.com) to learn the
basics. Once you can type confidently you can hone your skills on the
incredible [zty.pe](http://zty.pe).
